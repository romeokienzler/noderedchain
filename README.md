# NodeREDChain - 
##Â A ProofOfWork based Blockchain example on NodeRED

This is an example how a blockchain can be implemented on NodeRED - this is not for production! I'm using this example in my trainings


FYI - the RSA example (example without PoW) is work in progress - just put in what we have already - PKI is missing, so currently the public key is hard-coded...
